PrettyPrintHTML5Rocks
=====================

A Google Chrome extension to prettify and print articles from http://www.html5rocks.com

This is a chrome extension for printing the articles from http://www.html5rocks.com
It removes the unnecessary elements from the pages and then print them.

Originally the idea came to me because printing the articles from html5rocks wasted a lot of paper. So I decided to make an extension of my own.
This enabled me to start learning how to make chrome extensions, and how to use git.

Since the time I started this extension, the people at html5rocks, have improved their website (They added a media querie for print mode).
Due to their work my extension is almost not needed, except they didn't implemented it the way I think is optimal.
So for now I haven't decided topull down the repo from github, but I now am having doubts about whether I should publish this extension on webstore or not.

Even If I don't publish the extension on webstore, I will put up the steps to install extension locally, from one's own computer.
In the hoope that if anybody ever gets to this extension, knows how to use it if they don't know already.
